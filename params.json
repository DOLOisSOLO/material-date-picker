{"name":"Material-date-picker","tagline":"A simple material datepicker ","body":"## Angular material datepicker\r\n![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/dexQ7sd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis small component is still in production it's a simple date picker based on the angular-material port of polymer by the people behind ionic\r\n\r\nhttps://material.angularjs.org/\r\n\r\n##Install\r\nThis component is bower and npm registered \r\n```css\r\nbower install material-date-picker\r\nnpm install material-date-picker\r\n```\r\nAll the necessary files will be automatically included in your index.html if not add\r\n```css\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bower_components/material-date-picker/build/styles/mbdatepicker.css/>\r\n    <script src=\"bower_components/material-date-picker/build/mbdatepicker.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n###Attributes\r\n```html\r\n\r\n<mb-datepicker element-id='date1'\r\n               date-message=\"\"\r\n               text-color=\"#EFEF23\"\r\n               line-color=\"#DDFE66\"\r\n               line-thickness=\"3\"\r\n               date=\"date\"\r\n               date-format=\"YYYY-MM-DD\"></mb-datepicker>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the following attributes you can adjust the text color or border color of the input without lifting a css finger\r\nHowever if you want to adjust the datepicker inner-colors, as for now you have to override those in css.\r\n\r\nAn example is provided.\r\n\r\n##Known issues\r\nIf you can't find the SVG images, look in the images map of the bower component and copy these to your own images map. I left this as an open option.\r\nThe datepicker is known to throw a JQuery light error because of the way the styles are applied to generate enabled or disabled dates.\r\nIt does not lag the performance, I find it to be ugly, it will be the next thing on my list to fix.\r\n\r\n##Notes\r\nThe datepicker has changed enormously since the last commit, thinking no one used it I did not update the documents so here's an update\r\n\r\nIf you have an improvement or request please let me know or post a pull request\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
